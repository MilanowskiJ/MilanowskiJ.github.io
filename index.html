        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am Jake Milanowski. I excel in both low level code and high level design. 
          With a passion for mathematics and art, my skillset finds the intersection between form and function. Here in lies interest in language fundementals, machine learning, and cryptography.
          So, if you are interested in writing a scheme interpreter wholey in Maplesoft, creating programmer-centric assembly languages, or designing artificial intelligence oriented FPGA systems, I will always be interested.</p>
        <p>Outside of computer science I am creative before anything else. My endevours include trips into the world of watercolor, writing, political action, world building, cooking, history, and more things I could not fit in my day. 
          I have a history of public speaking, leadership, and thinking quickly on my feet. As a national competitor in extemporaneous speaking and a near daily Game Master for hosts of role playing games
          I have to be.
